The dataset comprises of details about the customer as well as the information regarding the bookings done by the customer. We explored the data set, applied pre-processing techniques, used different prediction models thereby trying to improve the champion model and concluded with managerial findings.
Our analysis includes the below points:
•	We explored the data set and tried to understand the data better by using Variable selection node. Also, we removed skewness and identified top variables that predicted the target.
•	We used impute node to fill in those missing values from the dataset.
•	We applied various prediction models such as Decision tree, Interactive Decision tree, Regression model, Neural Networks. Model comparison concluded that Neural Networks gave better results.
•	To improve the performance of the model, we tried sampling using Principal components but did not fetch us the desired results.
•	We tried bagging and boosting methods along with ensemble which gave us the best misclassification rate 10.9%
•	Based on the outcomes of the project, we concluded with few managerial findings.
